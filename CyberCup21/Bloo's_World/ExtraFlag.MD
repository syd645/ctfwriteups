This is the first suchallenge for Bloo's World and it states: 

_Time to warm up! Can you get the extra flag on the home page?_

On the Home Page there is a button that says "Recieve an Extra Flag" but you are unable to press it.

So I looked at the source code to see if I could enable the button. I found the location of the button attributes, and saw that it was listed as a disabled button.
