We were provided with this following statement:
_We found this password hash, can you somehow crack it?_
_29aa7acafb73866d6571e1a72f46c146_ 

I used a website to find out what type of hash it was, and that gave me MD4 or MD5.

I then used a different website to decrypt it, which gave me the output of _Apple123_ , which was the flag.
